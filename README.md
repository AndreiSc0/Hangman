Hangman Game

This game runs and can be interacted in a console.

This game was created using basic Python codes, as it is my first project. If you don't mind, I want to showcase this in my portfolio.

Please be advised that for changing the word needed to be guessed by the player, you will have to update the code on line 7: word = "StarWars".lower()

Update the user word "StarWars", to any desired word, and let the game begin.
