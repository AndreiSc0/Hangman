Hangman Game

This is a Hangman game created using object-oriented Python programming language (classes).

This game runs and can be interacted in a console.

This game was created using simple codes as it is one of my first projects. 

Please be advised that for changing the word needed to be guessed by the player, you will have to update the code on line 7: word = "StarWars".lower()
Update the user word "StarWars" to any desired word, and let the game begin. 

This game was created using simple codes as it is my first project in Python. If you don't mind, I want to showcase this in my portfolio.
